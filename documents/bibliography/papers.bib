abstract = {A T1 space in which the intersection or any countably many open sets is open, is called a P-space. In the present paper some basic topological properties of these spaces are studied. Three main results are a characterization of regular paracompact P-spaces, a product theorem for realcompact P-spaces and an example of a Hausdorff connected P-space.}
